        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This raspberry cream cheese cake is a wonderful alternative to those standard cinnamon and walnut streusel coffee cake recipes. It's perfect for a brunch or special family gathering. Prepping the batter in a food processor makes it quick and easy to assemble.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
                <li>Make the cake: Combine flour, sugar, and butter in a food processor; pulse until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Remove 1 cup of mixture and set aside for topping.</li>
                <li>Add sour cream, egg, almond extract, baking soda, baking powder, and salt to the food processor. Process until batter is combined and smooth, then pour into the prepared pan. Spread over the bottom and 2 inches up the sides.</li>
                <li>Make the cream cheese layer: Beat cream cheese, sugar, and egg in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Pour over batter in the pan and spread evenly. Carefully spread preserves over top.</li>

                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is set and topping is golden brown, 45 to 55 minutes.</li>
